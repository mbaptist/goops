The change in implementation and interface is being done by parts:

  1) merge all homogeneous scalar ffts and express the homogeneous vector ffts using the new scalar ffts
  2) merge homogeneous vector ffts, using the advanced interface,  and express heterogeneous ffts in terms of this new implementation
  3) possibly use guru interface for heterogeneous ffts

Unused files will be moved here and the whole directory will be removed in the end. This allows for changes to be recorded in he svn repo
